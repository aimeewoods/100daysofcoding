Potato coder hash(brown)tag: 100 Days of Coding

********************

"LET'S GOOOO PYTHON"
********************
Days 1-7: "Hello World!"  |  Data Types  |  Functions and Conditions  |  Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples

Days 8-16: Loops  |  Nested Loops  | Complex Functions  

Days 17-20:  Importing |  Intro to OOP  |  Classes

And now I'm on DAY 21: Continuing with Classes  | Attributes and Methods  |  Inheritance and Scope

Day 22: Still working on Inheritance and Scope | Built-in Functions

I feel like learning C first would have been the better foundational option.

Day 23: Python Modules. 
______________________
Up until now, I've felt totally lost and when I looked at code. It felt as if I was reading ancient hieroglyphs with no key to interpret what I was seeing. Today, all the puzzle pieces finally started falling into place. I watched Harvard's CS50 Python section and I was able to absolutely nail the answers to questions and accurately predict the code. It felt pretty awesome and gave me a lot of hope.

Day 24 & 25: Psuedocode and Planning  
I'm trying to solidify what I've learned so far, and I'm returning to videos and tutorials to make foundations really "stick". I'm currently watching Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Python. 
David Malan is absolutely fantastic. I also coded a basic drink ordering system with my son.

Day 26: Today I'm creating another program and continuing with CS50's Introduction to Python videos. I'll be defining my program, writing the pseudocode, and writing some or all of the code (depending on complexity).
Day 27: I'm trying to understand pseudocode. Building a program is a bit more complicated when starting from scratch so I'm still reviewing Harvard's Intro to Python course while trying to build a METAR decoding program.
