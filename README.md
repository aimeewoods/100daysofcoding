I feel like learning C first would have been the better foundational option.

Day 23: Python Modules.

Up until now, I've felt totally lost and when I looked at code. It felt as if I was reading ancient hieroglyphs with no key to interpret what I was seeing. Today, all the puzzle pieces finally started falling into place. I watched Harvard's CS50 Python section and I was able to absolutely nail the answers to questions and accurately predict the code. It felt pretty awesome and gave me a lot of hope.

Day 24 & 25: Psuedocode and Planning  
I'm trying to solidify what I've learned so far, and I'm returning to videos and tutorials to make foundations really "stick". I'm currently watching Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Python. 
David Malan is absolutely fantastic. I also coded a basic drink ordering system with my son.
